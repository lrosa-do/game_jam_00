# `x + <small int literal>` / `x - <small int literal>` compile to
# OP_ADDI / OP_SUBI (one instruction, no LOADI temporary). The peephole is
# purely an encoding change: every left-operand type must behave exactly as
# it would through OP_ADD / OP_SUB with the same literal in a register. This
# file pins that contract, contrasting the folded form with a form the
# peephole cannot fold (the literal held in a variable).
